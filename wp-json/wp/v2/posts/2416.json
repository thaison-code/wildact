Alongside research activities, awareness campaigns were conducted in four buffer zone villages, engaging 120 local residents. These sessions provided a platform for discussions on wildlife protection laws, helping to reduce poaching and illegal trade.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2344\" src=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh17-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Educational activities in the buffer zone of the region\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh17-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh17.jpg 559w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2345\" src=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh14-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Educational activities in the buffer zone of the region\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh14-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh14.jpg 574w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The awareness programs were supported by representatives from the park\u2019s tourism service board and forest rangers. The enthusiastic participation of local residents, particularly through legal knowledge quizzes, highlighted a positive shift in awareness toward protecting the Southern Yellow-Cheeked Gibbon and other wildlife species.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, from January 2 to 4, 2025, a capacity-building workshop was held for 20 forest rangers and park staff. The training introduced the Distance Sampling method, enhancing their ability to estimate population sizes and monitor the species more effectively.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2346\" src=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh19-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Training to enhance investigative capacity\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh19-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh19.jpg 617w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2347\" src=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh18-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Training to enhance investigative capacity\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh18-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/Anh18.jpg 617w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Notably, this project is driven by a team of young female conservationists who are championing community involvement, especially among women and ethnic minorities, in wildlife conservation. Their efforts not only contribute to protecting the Southern Yellow-Cheeked Gibbon but also promote a sustainable ecosystem at Chu Yang Sin. For the next steps, the project team will continue to implement awareness-raising activities, including distributing newsletters about wildlife-related legal violations and organizing a wildlife knowledge competition for students to increase information accessibility and the project&#8217;s effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>To expand the positive impact of women-led conservation initiatives, WildAct calls for collaboration and investment from organizations, businesses, and individuals committed to empowering women in conservation. Supporting these initiatives not only helps safeguard biodiversity but also fosters deeper local community participation in conservation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>This is a crucial opportunity to create lasting change for both nature and people.
