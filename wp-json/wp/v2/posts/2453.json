This means each ranger is tasked with protecting approximately 600 hectares of forest &#8211; a daunting responsibility that highlights the immense pressures and challenges they face.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having worked closely with these guardians of the forest on multiple patrols, Mr. L\u00ea Qu\u1ed1c Th\u01b0\u1edfng, Species and Habitat Program Manager at WildAct, shared: \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For rangers, enduring grueling treks over rugged mountains and through treacherous streams for days on end is just part of the job. Many ranger stations remain severely under-resourced, with some even lacking access to clean water, making an already harsh reality even more challenging<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond these harsh living conditions, rangers constantly face dangers from illegal loggers and poachers. Cases such as a ranger being shot in 2018 or seven rangers narrowly escaping an attack in early 2022 underscore these risks. Yet, driven by passion and commitment, they persist in safeguarding Ch\u01b0 Yang Sin\u2019s vast forests.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With deforestation and wildlife poaching on the rise, recognizing and honoring the dedication of rangers has never been more urgent. Following the success of the first Guardians of Ch\u01b0 Yang Sin Awards in March 2024, season 2 marks a significant turn by expanding participation. In addition to acknowledging the contributions of rangers and forest protection teams, this year\u2019s awards also celebrate the tireless efforts of local communities in preserving their ancestral lands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Trang Nguyen, Founder and Director of WildAct, emphasized the spirit of the awards: \u201c<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, we continue to stand alongside the guardians of the forest, supporting them as they navigate their journey of protecting Vietnam\u2019s natural heritage &#8211; a journey filled with challenges, dangers, and also deep fulfillment. Each story reflects a unique perspective, yet all share the same mission: to resiliently safeguard our nation\u2019s green lungs and biodiversity. Behind every protected forest lies grueling patrols, multiple hardships, along with the profound joy of dedicating oneself to preserving every stretch of wilderness and the creatures that call it home.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<\/span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2446 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wildact-vn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/2504_WA_GTKLCYS-68-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of three months, the awards received nearly 60 nominations, showcasing the relentless efforts to protect Ch\u01b0 Yang Sin\u2019s wildlife and ecosystems.
