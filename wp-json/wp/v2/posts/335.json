WRAP-UP CONFERENCE FOR THE MIGRATORY BIRD PROJECT ?<\/p>\n<p>? To reflect on the 4-year journey of protecting migratory birds in the Red River Delta, WildAct held the Wrap-up Conference for the Migratory Bird Project on December 13, 2024, at Con Den, Thai Binh.<\/p>\n<p>\u2728 The conference was honored to welcome nearly 20 special guests, including representatives from the Forest Protection Department, the Women&#8217;s Union, the Department of Education, the Farmers&#8217; Union, and the management boards of secondary schools from Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, and Nam Dinh. This event provided an opportunity for delegates to reflect on their efforts and proud achievements while planning effective strategies for the conservation of migratory birds in 2025:<br \/>\n? Awareness Raising and Education: Knowledge about conservation must continue to be integrated into school curriculums to help future generations understand the value of nature and their responsibilities toward all species.<br \/>\n? Women in Conservation: Women play a pivotal role in protecting nature. They are the torchbearers, the sources of inspiration, and role models for their communities.<br \/>\n? Regulations for Migratory Bird Protection: Policies to reduce the hunting of migratory birds and other wildlife need to be established and adjusted flexibly to suit the specific enforcement conditions of each locality.<\/p>\n<p>\u2728 WildAct sincerely thanks all the delegates who attended the conference and contributed valuable insights. Together, we hope to launch even more impactful initiatives for migratory bird conservation in the future.<\/p>\n<p>#WildAct #WeActforWildlife #MigratoryBird #MigratoryBirdConservation #ChimDiC\u01b0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>?
