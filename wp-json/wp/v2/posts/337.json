Young conservationists from UNIS Hanoi got a firsthand experience with Dr. Trang Nguyen, exploring animal welfare and conservation in action!<\/p>\n<p>? Guided by Dr. Trang Nguyen, students from UNIS Hanoi had the unique opportunity to become a conservationist for a day. Through a hands-on field trip to the zoo, they deepened their understanding of wildlife conservation and animal welfare. Engaging in both individual and group activities, they observed and assessed animal welfare, applying real-world conservation principles under Dr. Trang\u2019s guidance.<\/p>\n<p>? Through the \u201cday in the life of a conservationist\u201d activity, Dr. Trang and WildAct hopes to provide young conservationists with a solid foundation in animal welfare and conservation. More than just a learning opportunity, the trip sought to inspire students to take responsibility for protecting wildlife and to become advocates for change within their communities.<\/p>\n<p>#WildAct #WeActforWildlife #Education #Conservation #WildlifeProtection<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>?
